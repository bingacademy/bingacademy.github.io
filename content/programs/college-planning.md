We take a holistic approach to guide students preparing for college applications.

## College Planning Services | 大学升学规划服务 


We help students plan for various aspects of their high school years | 我们从以下申请要素，帮助孩子做量身定制的规划：

- Courses (what and when to take) | 如何选课 
- Standardized tests (what and when to take)  |  标准测验
- Extracurricular activities (academic and non-academic/volunteer work) | 课外活动（学术和非学术及志愿活动）
- Summer activities selection and application | 暑期活动的选择和申请

A counselor will meet with the student once a month and communicate with
parents/student whenever needed. | 老师会与学生每个月见一次面，并随时与学生家长进行沟通。
