More than 20 years ago, we immigrated to the United States with a common goal for our children to have the best education, live a prosperous life, and have an unlimited future. We began our interest in the American education system from 2004, and began college planning for our children as early as elementary school. There were no suitable counselors or programs for us at that time. Instead, we studied through books and online research; we learned cases personally by reaching out to universities, parents, teachers, and students. Through these we found how the advanced American education concept is drastically different from China. The system builds upon primary reading, writing and mathematics from a young age and advances to developing a child's inner traits and other potentials. It encourages their enthusiasm for learning, building self-confidence, leadership, and community service capabilities. Such efforts not only allow students to successfully apply to prestigious universities, but also integrate into society, and lay a good foundation for their independent adaptation to American life in the future. Immigration is an important turning point not only for parents, but especially for children. Coming here means a higher starting point and a different educational concept. We believe with our years of expertise, our institution can help support your child's growth for a better future in the United States.

20多年前，我们移民来了美国， 虽然移民的理由每个人不一样，但是有一个共同的理由就是为了孩子能够享受这个世界强国的教育资源，让孩子在美国的一生生活富足，有更好的未来。我们从小学起开始关注美国的教育体系，从2004年起，我们开始为孩子准备申请大学做出规划。那时市场上没有合适的咨询老师，我们通过各种网上及书本调查研究学习，同时与大学，家长，老师，及学生的实地了解，发现美国先进的高中及大学的教育理念与中国截然不同，他们通过小学时打下的英语阅读写作及数学基础知识，初中高中开始关注孩子内在的特质爱好，发掘孩子的潜力，鼓励激发孩子的学习热情，从而建立起自信心，领导力，社区服务能力，通过这样的努力，既可以让孩子成功申请到美国名校，得到美国主流社会认可，更是为他们以后独立适应美国生活工作打下良好基础。移民对于孩子来说，是重要的转折点。一个更高的起点，一个完全不同的教育理念，对孩子来说至关重要，我们的经验可以在孩子的成长之路上雪中送炭，锦上添花。
